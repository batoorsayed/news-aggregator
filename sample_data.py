            "A federal judge in Los Angeles has ordered a halt to immigration sweeps by the Trump administration, highlighting concerns from civil rights groups about racially indiscriminate arrests in southern California. The judge's ruling points to evidence suggesting that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and Border Patrol are engaging in illegal activities by rounding up individuals based on race and denying them legal representation. Civil rights organizations have been vocal in their allegations, contributing to the judicial scrutiny of these enforcement practices. The judge's decision underscores the legality issues surrounding the sweeps, though specific details of the ruling or the full extent of the arrests were not provided in the source document. This development indicates a judicial response to what appears to be a pattern of discriminatory enforcement actions. The judge's order aims to address these concerns, though the long-term implications for immigration policy enforcement remain to be seen."
